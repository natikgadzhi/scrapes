# Scrapes

Scrapes is an iOS and a Mac Catalyst app that allows you to see and copy your
Kindle highlights nad notes in a clean and simple UI.

It's a hobby project. I made the app for myself, and it barely works. It's not
on App Store or Test Flight yet, and I don't intend to build anything complex.

It's built entirely in the open:
- Issues on this repo are my development notes.
- Here's the [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/natikgadzhi/projects/1/views/1)

Tech details:
- Targeting iOS 17 and MacOS 14.
- SwiftUI
- SwiftData
- SwiftSoup for parsing Kindle web reader markup.
